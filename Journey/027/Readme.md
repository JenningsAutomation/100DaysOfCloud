# CloudFormation Basics

## Introduction

✍️ For the foreseable future, I will be diving headfirst into cloud formation. CloudFormation is a way to create infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisite

✍️ A general familiarity of how to navigate AWS.

## Use Case

- Cloud Formation is a great clean way to build infrastructure as well as take it down cleanly. Most AWS services can be created with cloud formation.

## Cloud Research

- AWS Devops by Stephane Maarek.


### Step 1 — Select Create Stack
Head over to CloudFormation and select "Create stack" with new resources.

### Step 6 — Stack is Created
The stack was successfully created, however over time you may want to update or delete the stack. We will update the stack with extra security groups and elastic IP. Click on Update from main dashboard.

### Step 8 — Describe Security group
I'll add a description and accept the next page options for stack options.


### Step 9 — Preview the changes
The changes are previewed. Everything looks ok, I'll submit

### Step 11 — Delete the stack
Everything looks good, however if we to delete the stack and all of its recources it's as easy as deleting the stack in Stackformation.
