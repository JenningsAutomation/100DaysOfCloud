# Splunk and Suricata

## Cloud Research

- Today I spent a considerable amount of time working through a lab setting up Splunk and suricata. My material was Lab, Module 05 Network Security Controls - Technical Controls from eccouncil. It was long and tedious, and I had to restart several times, and I still didn't get it right. But I suppose there will be days like this. I'll revisit it again tomorrow.
