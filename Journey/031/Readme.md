# Create Java Project DevSecops Pipeline

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è This pipeline will implement SonarCloud for Static Analysis testing (SAST), OWASP Zap for Dynamic Analysis System Testing (DAST) and Snyk for Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è You should be familiar with CodePipeline, setting IAM permissions, know how to create an S3 bucket.

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è This is a realistic implementation of a devsecops pipeline.

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è I'm following asecurityguru's course AWS Security: DevSecOps & AWS Security Services & Terraform.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è Overall it was a good practical exercise for implementing complete analysis. There are a lot of small configurations that can make the pipeline fail. So it is a process that should be practiced consistently to be implemented properly.

## Next Steps

‚úçÔ∏è I actually, just want to keep practicing it.

## Social Proof

‚úçÔ∏è Show that you shared your process on Twitter or LinkedIn
