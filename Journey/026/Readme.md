# Add Manual Approval Steps

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è In this day we study how to add extra manual approval steps to the CodePipeline.

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è This pipeline has been built previously, so you should have that. Otherwise, you need to generally know how to manuever around AWS.

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è In these examples, I add parallel and sequential steps to the CodePipeline, and include a manual approval step as one final check before code is released to production.

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è The source of this material is from Stephane maarek's course AWS Devops 2022. This pipeline was completed in previous days. Those are in my repository.


### Step 1 ‚Äî Edit Deploy Stage

### Step 2 ‚Äî Add parallel action

### Step 3 ‚Äî Edit actions
So now when it does deploy it will upload to S3 at the same time
Click Done and Save

### Step 4 ‚Äî Test by making a change in codeCommit repository


### Step 5 ‚Äî Edit the index.html file in CodeCommit. Change V10 to V11.

### Step 6 ‚Äî Commit Changes

### Step 7 ‚Äî Upload to other S3 Successful

### Step 8 ‚Äî Add Manual Approval Stage

Add a sequential step after deploy. This will be our deploy to production stage.

### Step 9 ‚Äî Add Action Group

### Step 10 ‚Äî Make Edits to depoly to MyProductionInstances

### Step 11 ‚Äî Add Action group Above DeployToProd

This is where we will add a manual approval steps. To verify changes before they are released to production.

### Step 12 ‚Äî Edit Action

Here we set up the manual steps. Provide the optional steps of sending an sns topic and providing the dev url to review before releasing changes to Production.

### Step 13 ‚Äî Click done, save and release change

Now when before changes are released to production they will have to be manually approved

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è This was an important step to learn. It's a way to implement checks and balances. Also, it shows the difference between parallel and sequential stages.

## Next Steps

‚úçÔ∏è What ever is left to learn from Codepipeline.
