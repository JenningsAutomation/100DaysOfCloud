# Lambda -Versions, Aliases and canary routing

## Introduction

✍️ Today session I looked at Lambda Versions and Aliases. Probably one of the more confusing mainly because the lambda function UI has changed considerably. It takes practice to get used to it all.

## Use Case

- ✍️ Versions allow you to build different versions of your lambda function. Aliases would be goog for let's say having Dev and Prod versions. 

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ The material is from Stephane Maarek's Devops course on udemy
