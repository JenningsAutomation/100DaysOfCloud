# Api Gateway

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è API Gateway is a service that easily allows you to spin up an API from a variety of sources like lambda, ec2 and others. Today I created a simple API that used a lambda function as its source. 

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è You should know how lambda functions work and how to create them. You should also have a general idea of http protocol and verbs.

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è Quickly create an API. You also have the options of using different deployments and stages for example using blue/green deployment.

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è The material is from Stephane Maarek's Udemy course on AWS Devops. Also some of the official AWS documentation.

## Try yourself

### Step 1 ‚Äî Create an API

### Step 3 ‚Äî Set API settings
I will create a New regional API

### Step 4 ‚Äî Create Method
Choose Get from the dropdown

### Step 5 ‚Äî Choose Integration
As our integration type, we will choose a lambda function. So we will make a demo lambda function for this

### Step 6 ‚Äî Create Lambda Function

### Step 7 ‚Äî Select Lambda Function
Refresh the page and begin typing in the lambda function you just created, it should auto-complete. Click save and accept the next screen.

### Step 9 ‚Äî Deploy API
From the Actions menu click on deploy. Create a new stage named DEV

### Step 10 ‚Äî Invoke URL
Once the API is deployed a new stage will be created and a public url will be supplied

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è After building many api's I thought this was a relatively easy quick method to spin up an api with tons of options like authenticating users, using cognito and creating api keys. I can't wait to see what else I can do with this.

## Next Steps

‚úçÔ∏è Dig deeper into api gateway.
