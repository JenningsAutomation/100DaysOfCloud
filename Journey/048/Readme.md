## Cloud Research

- ✍️ Today, I figured it was time to dive into AWS iOT. My first order of business was to setup a sample breadboard setup using an esp8266 taking temperature readings from a DHT22 temperature sensor. Eventually, I will incorporate this into a larger project using AWS iOT Core. I had a few struggles getting everything to read, but hey thats called learning.
