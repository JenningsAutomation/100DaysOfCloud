# Elastic Beanstalk

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. Upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment‚Äîfrom capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring.

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è General AWS skills. 

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è If you want to have a structure set up automatically with everything that you might need use elastic beanstalk.

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è My source material is from Stephane Maarek's, AWS Devops course on udemy.


### Step 1 ‚Äî Install ebcli
from the command line install Elastic Beanstalk CLI

```
pip install awscli --upgrade --user
```

verify installation by typing
```
eb
```
 you should say all available commands
### Step 2 ‚Äî Create a project
```
mkdir HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
eb init
```
follow all of the prompts, region, Application Name, PHP, and SSh keys

```
echo "Hello World" > index.html
eb create dev-env
```

### Step 3 ‚Äî View Appliction

to view:
```
eb open
```

### Step 4 ‚Äî What did we make

to view:
```
eb open
```

### Step 5 ‚Äî eb status

to view:
```
eb open
```

### Step 6 ‚Äî eb health

to view:
```
eb open
```

![Screenshot](step6-eb-health.png)

### Step 7 ‚Äî eb health --refresh
will refresh every 10 seconds
to view:
```
eb open
```

### Step 8 ‚Äî eb logs
views all the logs
to view:
```
eb open
```

### Step 9 ‚Äî Saved Configurations
allows to quickly reproduce an elastic beanstalk
The first step is to backup the current dev configuration
```
eb config save dev-env --cfg initial-configuration
```
That command will create a saved_configs directory and a initial-cofiguration.cfg.yml

### Step 10 ‚Äî Save Environment Variable

```
eb setenv ENABLE_COOL_NEW_FEATURE=true
```

![Screenshot](step10-setenv.png)

### Step 11 ‚Äî Save New State
We will now save our config from the current state
```
eb config save dev-env --cfg prod
```
That will save the config in prod.cfg.yml

![Screenshot](step11b-new-prod-config.png)

### Step 12 ‚Äî Modifying a config
What if we would like to make a change? We will do the following:
- add an environment variable
- add auto scaling rules
Add this on the bottom of the OptionSettings section.
```
  AWSEBAutoScalingScaleUpPolicy.aws:autoscaling:trigger:
    UpperBreachScaleIncrement: '2'
  AWSEBCloudwatchAlarmLow.aws:autoscaling:trigger:
    LowerThreshold: '20'
    MeasureName: CPUUtilization
    Unit: Percent
  AWSEBCloudwatchAlarmHigh.aws:autoscaling:trigger:
    UpperThreshold: '50'
```

### Step 13 ‚Äî Update config
then update the saved prod configuration
```
eb config put prod
```

### Step 14 ‚Äî Apply config
then update the saved prod configuration
```
eb config dev-env --cfg prod
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è I personally like how you can have everything you need in application. It's a great way to build especially if you are inexperienced with AWS

## Next Steps

‚úçÔ∏è There's more to learn about different configurations with elastic beanstalk
