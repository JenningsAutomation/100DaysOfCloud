# CodeDeploy Cleanup

## Introduction

✍️ Investigate several areas before I move on from CodeDeploy. I looked at hooks, cloudwatch events, logs, events, alarms and triggers. CodeDeploy rollbacks, on-premise instances setup and finally deploying to AWS lambda.

## Use Case

- ✍️ Just different ways to deploy based on what you need.

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ AWS Certified Devops engineer 2022, by Stephane Maarek

## Social Proof

✍️ Show that you shared your process on Twitter or LinkedIn
