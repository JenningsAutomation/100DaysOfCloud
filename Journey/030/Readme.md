# More CloudFormation

## Introduction

✍️ Today, was a mixed bag as far as learning. I covered a bunch of options all related to CloudFormation. They are very different, and it would've been difficult to make a cohesive tutorial. That's why I'm using the medium template today.

## Use Case

- ✍️ More ways to configure your CloudFormation.

## Cloud Research

- ChangeSets,DeletionPolicy, TerminationProtection, Parameters from SSM, Deploying lambda functions, drift detection, status codes, cfn-hup & metadata, and stack policies.

## Social Proof

✍️ Show that you shared your process on Twitter or LinkedIn
