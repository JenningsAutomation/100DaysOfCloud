# Stepfunctions

## Introduction

✍️ Today I went through the AWS Step function documentation and did the 8 getting started tutorials. They can be found here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/getting-started-with-sfn.html

## Use Case

- ✍️ Step functions are a way to orchestrate complicated scenarios

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ The tutorial was logical to follow all the way up to tutorial 6, then it became hard to follow. UI changes can through you off.
