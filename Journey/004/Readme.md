# Automate Infrastructure as with Terraform

## Introduction

✍️ I want to learn how to automate infrascture as code with terraform. I'm interested in the devsecops space and I see that terraform is used.

## Use Case

- ✍️ Terraform lets build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking; and high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ I followed the tutorials on the Terraform site under Amazon Web Services
